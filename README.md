## Hello there, friend!

This is my application website for the **Founders and Coders** Programme in London. 
If you don't know what that is, check out their website [here](https://foundersandcoders.com/)! 

**TL;DR** They're an awesome non-profit that gives amazing web development teaching to coding newbies like me (for free!) 
while helping other charities, non-profits and start-ups with projects.

This is my first, published project on GitHub so _be kind to me please!_

In this project I've used: 
* HTML _(obvs)_.
* Pure CSS, including Flexbox (and floats, because I'm old school. _read: I haven't mastered grid layout._)
* A tiny dusting of JavaScript.
* Mobile first Development Practices.

If you want to see more JavaScript from me, check out my calculator project [here](https://github.com/developess/calculator).

I'm proud to say I learnt to code and completed this project with no help other than 
the knowledge google, treehouse and freeCodeCamp provided me. 

Thanks for reading!
